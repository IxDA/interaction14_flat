				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you methodical in your design approach? Three sessions address this question explicitly. One is about striving for simplicity and efficiency, one about the importance of hypothesis construction in the design process, and one is about understanding how our brain works.<span id="more-634"></span></p>
<h3>Captivated by simplicity</h3>
<p>On Thursday afternoon, Giles Colborne will speak about the <a href="http://interaction14.ixda.org/program/thursday/347-the-lost-art-of-efficiency-in-interaction-design">The lost art of efficiency in interaction design</a>.</p>
<p>As you may already know, Giles Colborne wrote &#8220;<a href="http://www.simpleandusable.com">Simple and Usable Web, Mobile and Interaction Design</a>.  Michelle Berryman, director of experience design at THINK Interactive reviewed this book in September 2013: &#8220;It is direct and on point. Everyone tasked with creating digital products and experiences should read this book. It&#8217;s perhaps one of the best design books I&#8217;ve read in recent years.</p>
<p>I plan to re-visit it occasionally as a reminder of what really matters for users. Great work doesn&#8217;t just happen &#8211; and good intentions aren&#8217;t enough. Great work is about making difficult decisions throughout a project. Great work is about being simple and usable in the moment, when it matters, for the target audience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Similar <a href="http://cfsimplicity.com/37/simple-and-usable-by-giles-colborne">praise</a> comes from web developer Julian Halliwell: &#8220;I&#8217;ve read quite a few technical and design books which discuss simplicity in passing, but it&#8217;s rare to come across one that focuses on it exclusively and authoritatively.&#8221;</p>
<p>His book is an attempt to distill twenty years of interaction design experience into a handbook of practical strategies for actually achieving simplicity &#8211; not just paying lip-service to it.</p>
<h3>Use hypotheses instead of requirements</h3>
<p>How do you manage design in an agile context?  How do you take the risk out of software development?</p>
<p>In their Wednesday morning workshop Josh Seiden and Jeff Gothelf will answer questions like these as they take you on a deep dive into &#8220;<a href="http://interaction14.ixda.org/program/wednesday/131-hypothesis-writing">Hypothesis Writing: Using Hypotheses to Align Design, Business and Technology</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a February 2012 <a href="http://joshuaseiden.com/blog/2012/02/replacing-requirements-with-hypotheses-at-agile-ux-nyc/">talk at Agile UX NYC</a>, Josh argued why it&#8217;s important to frame challenges not as requirements, but as hypotheses.</p>
<p>At Interaction14, Josh and Jeff will take their thinking another step forward. In their <a href="http://interaction14.ixda.org/program/wednesday/131-hypothesis-writing">morning workshop</a> they will be sharing hands-on experience with hypothesis writing. Neither Josh nor Jeff are newcomers at Interaction conferences. Josh spoke at <a href="http://interaction13.ixda.org/program/#session-73">Interaction13</a>, and Jeff spoke at <a href="http://interaction12.ixda.org/programme/#session-38">Interaction12</a>.</p>
<h3>Experience vs memory</h3>
<p>Did you experience something or did you remember it?  On Saturday afternoon Lucinio Santos will apply Psychology and Behavioral Economics to answer that question. The title of his talk is <a href="http://interaction14.ixda.org/program/saturday/59-user-interaction">User Interaction: Experienced vs Remembered</a>.</p>
<p>In an article for <a href="http://www.usabilityprofessionals.org/uxmagazine/experiencing-change-the-new-and-the-old/">User Experience</a> magazine, he explains: &#8220;Why do we tend to overestimate recent technological change? There are two key factors: first is a memory-accessibility bias that leads us to underestimate the impact of past technological changes, which we did not experience. Second, we fail to realize the algorithmic nature of change. We focus on the cumulative aspect of innovation, distorting the perceived effect of an invention with the cumulative effect of previous technologies on which it is built, rather than on the before-and-after differences.&#8221;</p>
<p>Santos then goes back in time to look at some technological innovations of the late 18th century to see how past generations experienced extreme change.</p>
<p>The article also highlights what will drive his <a href="http://interaction14.ixda.org/program/saturday/59-user-interaction">Interaction14 talk</a>: how an experienced reality and a remembered (or reconstructed) reality can be entirely different things, and can often lead to biased interpretations, with all the implications this has for design.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>However you slice or dice it, our work is about designing interactions for people. Three of our talks are about people.  Read on. <span id="more-612"></span></p>
<h3>Unique just like everyone else<b> </b></h3>
<p>Get ready for a refreshing Saturday morning with Tash Wong. The tile of her talk is: <a href="http://interaction14.ixda.org/program/saturday/409-you-re-unique-just-like-everybody-else-or-how-your">You&#8217;re unique. Just like everybody else. Or how your perspective is limiting your work and hindering your team</a>.</p>
<p>Tash developed <a href="http://interactiondesign.sva.edu/people/project/think-bigger-make-better">Think Bigger, Make Better</a> a set of 16 cards designed to help you articulate your purpose, priorities, and perspective. Each card features a term, prompt, and examples that help get to the &#8216;why&#8217; of a project faster.</p>
<p>Initially inspired by gender differences as a lens to understand modes of interaction, her research resulted a tool that she describes as &#8220;a conversational framework designed to help designers articulate their ideas and perspectives, and to bridge the gap with others.&#8221;</p>
<p>She has since been exploring the topics that her thesis addressed on her <a href="http://tashwong.tumblr.com/">Tumblr blog</a>, and thought it might be a <a href="http://tashwong.tumblr.com/post/60041730817/after-a-summer-away-a-proposal-for-a-talk">nice topic for a talk</a>. Her Interaction14 talk will be her first conference talk ever.</p>
<h3>What we can learn from introverts</h3>
<p>Angela Craven and SuAnne Hall are introverts, which is the topic of their talk at Interaction14. Titled &#8220;<a href="http://interaction14.ixda.org/program/thursday/235-ux-awesomeness-through-the-introvert-extrovert-spectrum">UX Awesomeness Through the Introvert/Extrovert Spectrum</a>&#8220;, their talk will discusses how a good balance of extroverts and introverts can elevate great ideas and teams.</p>
<p>Their <a href="http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2013/10/09/incorporating-quiet-into-ux-design-process/">October 2013 article in Smashing Magazine</a> explores this greater depth. From conversations with introverted UX leaders, they uncovered the following strengths:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introverted UX&#8217;ers are great listeners</li>
<li>They are relatively humble</li>
<li>They make great problem solvers</li>
<li>They enjoy putting themselves in other people&#8217;s shoes</li>
<li>They over-prepare</li>
<li>They make good leaders</li>
<li>They can read a room</li>
</ul>
<p>The article explores how introverts can set themselves up for success, how best to work with introverts, and how we can leverage the quiet side in all of us. A recommended read &mdash; whether you attend their talk or not.</p>
<h3>How people choose</h3>
<p>If designers, developers and product owners understand how choices are made they will be better equipped to disrupt the market.</p>
<p>On Saturday afternoon, Brad Nunnelly will discuss <a href="http://interaction14.ixda.org/program/saturday/423-choice-gateway-to-engagement">Choice&#8230;Gateway to Engagement</a>. He explored the same theme at WebVisions Chicago 2013.   It is interesting to look at his <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/bnunnally/choice-engagement-webvisions">slides</a> and watch the <a href="https://www.ugtastic.com/brad-nunnally/">interview</a> that he gave to UGastic :</p>
<p>&#8220;My interest in choice really came about by my interest in attention, and how it works from a physiological and psychological standpoint. [&#8230;] [I asked myself] what are the other factors in choice? What plays a factor in choice? In addition to attention, it turned out it was environment and effort. [My talk is] a combination of psychology and neuroscience.&#8221;</p>
<p>His talk elaborates on ideas from the book &#8220;<a href="http://www.designingtheconversation.com">Designing the Conversation</a>&#8220;, which Brad Nunnally co-authored with Russ Unger and Dan Willis.</p>

<h3>The circle of visual interpretation<b></b></h3>
<p>In a Wednesday morning workshop, Dave Wood uses a visually interpretive method to reveal how user experience can communicate in ways that personas just can&#8217;t. His Interaction14 workshop, &#8220;<a href="http://interaction14.ixda.org/program/wednesday/286-circle-of-visual-interpretation-workshop">The circle of visual interpration</a>&#8220;, is a bit more academic than most. To avoid the trap of only learning from other practitioners, it is sometimes important to take a step back and look at our work from a more academic angle, be it psychology, sociology or in the case of Dave, semiotics.</p>
<p>In his new book, “<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Basics-Interactive-Design-01-Interface/dp/2940411999/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1358895583&amp;sr=1-1">Interface Design: An introduction to visual communication in UI Design</a>” he takes the reader through the hows, the whys and the wherefores of designing user interfaces from a graphic design perspective.</p>
<p><a href="http://internalexternal-2010.blogspot.co.uk">Dave Wood</a> is a prolific writer. You can download <a href="https://gcal.academia.edu/DaveWood/">his many papers</a>.</p>
<h3>Going through the motions</h3>
<p>On Saturday afternoon Antonio De Pasquale will discuss <a href="http://interaction14.ixda.org/program/saturday/241-design-in-motion">Design in motion: the new frontier of interaction</a>. A senior interaction designer at frog design in Milan, Antonio is convinced that animation can explain behaviors better than thousands of words and that&#8217;s why interaction designers should learn from motion designers.</p>
<p>His <a href="http://interaction14.ixda.org/program/saturday/241-design-in-motion">Interaction14 talk</a> elaborates on this idea. To get a taste of what his talk will cover, look at the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/antoniodepasquale/motion-gesture-interactions-in-the-digital-age">slides</a> of a similar talk he gave recently at <a href="http://www.codemotion.es/talk/19-october/202">CodeMotion</a> in Madrid, Spain.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The future of interaction design is in our hands. Can we create relevant training and education programs to move our industry forward?<span id="more-598"></span></p>
<h3>Interaction Design Education Summit</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/author/jared/">Jared Spool</a> barely needs <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Spool">an introduction</a>. Last year, together with Leslie Jensen-Inman – he started the <a href="http://unicorninstitute.com">Unicorn Institute</a>, a &#8220;research project rethinking user experience design education.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is how they describe their efforts:</p>
<p>&#8220;There is an increasing need for UX professionals. However, universities and colleges are not producing the types of graduates that industry can easily hire. The paradox is that there&#8217;s a gap in what&#8217;s currently taught in higher education and the practical needs of industry.</p>
<p>We can create the next generation of UX professionals, also known as Unicorns, by connecting industry, education, and community. The journey to &#8220;somewhere over the rainbow&#8221; starts here and starts now. The future of our discipline depends on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The school will have a two-year program centered around a project-based learning experience. Jared says in The Digital Life that they have divided the curriculum into eight categories: interaction design, information architecture, visual design, copywriting, user research, information design, design process management, and &#8220;curation and editing.&#8221;</p>
<p>With all this as a background, Jared will keynote the <a href="http://interaction14.ixda.org/program/wednesday/education-summit">Interaction Design Education Summit</a> at Interaction14 &#8211; a full day event that will be coached by Gillian Crampton Smith, Daniel Rosenberg and Fred Beecher.</p>
<h3>Apprenticeship in the real world</h3>
<p>Fred Beecher runs an innovative <a href="http://blog.nerdery.com/2013/02/user-experience-design-apprenticeship/">UX design apprenticeship program</a> at The Nerdery, the interactive production company.  In February 2013 he set out his vision in a <a href="http://blog.nerdery.com/2013/02/user-experience-design-apprenticeship/">blog post</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;For us, mentorship looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apprentices work with a principal mentor who is responsible for their overall skill development &amp; growth</li>
<li>The principal mentor works with sales &amp; management to identify the UX design methods being used on current &amp; incoming work</li>
<li>The principal mentor assigns apprentices to projects, which require methods that an apprentice needs to learn</li>
<li>The project&#8217;s lead UX designer mentors the apprentice for those methods</li>
<li>Designers can expect to mentor apprentices a few times per year for a short amount of time&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>Now one year later, Fred wants to share his insights at a Saturday morning <a href="http://interaction14.ixda.org/program/saturday/102-making-more-ux-designers">session at Interaction14</a>. The goal of his presentation, entitled &#8220;<b>Making More UX Designers: UX Apprenticeship in the Real World</b>,&#8221; is to make it easier for UX teams in other organizations to implement their own apprenticeship programs. This will ultimately make it easier for interested, talented, and passionate people to become UX designers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Looking at something from another perspective can expand your professional abilities.  Here are a few ways Interaction14 will open your eyes, open your minds and expand your horizons. <span id="more-590"></span></p>
<h3>Killing the wireframe machine</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://interaction14.ixda.org/program/wednesday/37-interaction-design-beyond-the-wireframe">workshop</a> of <b>Lis Hubert</b> is a call to action. <a href="http://www.elisabethhubert.com/">Lis</a> explores why and how UX is de-evolving from design thinking to wireframe machines, what problems this causes our web and mobile teams, the solutions to this de-evolution, and how to get UX to deliver on its promise.</p>
<p>She argues that we have to learn a process for synthesizing and strategizing the solution without the interface by addressing the following challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Who</b> am I working with?</li>
<li><b>Who</b> can help me solve the problem?</li>
<li><b>What</b> is the problem?</li>
<li><b>Who</b> am I solving it for?</li>
<li><b>What</b> is information/content that I&#8217;m working with?</li>
<li>Modeling the solution (sans interface)</li>
<li>Getting the team onboard</li>
<li><b>What</b> is the information priority?</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of Lis&#8217; previous presentations on SlideShare:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/lishubert/interaction-design-beyond-the-interface-workshop">Interaction Design beyond the Wireframe workshop</a> &mdash; April 30, 2013</li>
<li><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/lishubert/the-future-of-ux-killing-the-wireframe-machine">The Future of UX: Killing the Wireframe Machine talk</a> &mdash; November 14, 2013.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Jamming for change</h3>
<p>Opening our eyes and minds to new ways of looking at our world and practice is the focus of Thursday’s Jamming for Change session.</p>
<p><b>Steve Baty</b> will propose a conceptual leap: from <a href="http://interaction14.ixda.org/program/thursday/355-a-model-of-behavioural-design">experience design to behavioral design</a>.  This is driven by the fact that clients and designers care more about target behaviors and how to shape them than in experiences and emotional responses.<br />
In a <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1670839/listening-closer-to-find-the-next-big-interaction-idea">Fast Company article</a>, Baty provides insights on what we can expect from his talk. In the article, he identifies three ways to develop the required deep insight, which are all focused on looking beyond the obvious and staring directly into the blind spots of our accepted norms.</p>
<p><b>Anneli Olsen</b> will talk about what she has learned from doing a user experience evaluation of her cat. These <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/Tobii/slides-v13-20131010">hilarious slides</a> will whet your appetite. The session concludes with an explanation on how interaction design and service design can help alleviate urban poverty.</p>
<p><b>Lea Ward</b> will explain her work on the <a href="http://cnote.nl/portfolio-item/social-services-door-to-door-for-change/">Door-to-door for change</a> project, which tries to break the poverty cycle. It targets 150 families and tackles the intergenerational problem of &#8220;inherited poverty.” Research has shown that getting parents engaged has a positive effect on their children, who become more likely in turn to find work.</p>
<h3>Going back to his linguistics roots</h3>
<p>His Thursday talk at Interaction14, which he positions as a <a href="http://interaction14.ixda.org/program/thursday/273-your-friends-can-always-tell-when-you-re-on-the-phone-to">crash course in sociolinguistics</a>, is a return to his roots.  How has his take on sociolinguistics influenced his work as product designer?</p>
<p>His talk promises to be provocative: how does our language differ depending who we talk to, what are our hidden messages, and how d that influences our interaction design work and the exchange this creates with our customers?</p>
<h3>Privacy by design</h3>
<p>Privacy has been very much on the mind of cyber-anthropologist <b>Amber Case</b> for some years already. Amber was interviewed <a href="http://www.thetakeaway.org/story/62581-privacy-time-facebook/">by WNYC</a> and <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/player/Radio/Spark/ID/2233589447/?page=29&amp;sort=MostPopular">CBC Radio</a> (Canada) on Facebook and privacy as far back as 2010.</p>
<p>In 2011 she came to the <a href="https://vimeo.com/51660205" title="Video registration">DISH conference</a> in the Netherlands to discuss the implications to privacy, information and the formation of identity with our memories increasingly stored being in virtual space, and the ability to archive and access that data.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how her thoughts have evolved post-Snowden and in the more privacy-conscious Europe where her <a href="http://interaction14.ixda.org/program/friday/4-designing-for-privacy-in-mobile-and-web-apps">Interaction14 talk</a> will take place.</p>
<h3>The extended biology of computers</h3>
<p>The title of Steven Pemberton&#8217;s talk at Interaction14, <a href="http://interaction14.ixda.org/program/saturday/31-the-computer-as-extended-phenotype">The Computer as Extended Phenotype</a>, is exactly the same as <a href="https://vimeo.com/29289710">the one he gave</a> at the UX Week in San Francisco in 2011 (and which was <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1386">summarized</a> by Luke Wroblewski at the time).</p>
<p>The phenotype can be described as the visible, physical manifestation of our genes, he said in the talk. Most of these manifestations are part of the body, but some are outside (e.g. bird nests, beaver dams, spider webs, etc).</p>
<p>In humans, such &#8216;extended&#8217; phenotypes are our language (memes), clothes, glasses, cars and planes, and even&#8230; computers: &#8220;The computer is being used in so many ways to extend our abilities. I can see no other possibility than to regard it as part of our extended phenotype.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Storytelling can connect you emotionally with a product or idea. How can you use storytelling to improve your work as an interaction designer?<span id="more-578"></span></p>
<p>Interaction14 features several talks on storytelling. Here&#8217;s some background on the presenters.</p>
<h3>The power of storytelling</h3>
<p>Jeroen van Geel doesn&#8217;t need much introduction. If you didn&#8217;t see him at <a href="http://interaction12.ixda.org/programme/#session-80">Interaction12</a> or <a href="http://interaction13.ixda.org/program/#session-PNL6">Interaction13</a> [<a href="https://vimeo.com/61365007">video</a>], most of you have definitely explored <a href="http://johnnyholland.org">Johnny Holland</a>, the great site on interaction design and user experience that Jeroen created and edited.</p>
<p>Jeroen, who has probably the best smile in the interaction design community, is fascinated by storytelling. Both in designing projects as in talking or selling your work. The latter is the topic of his <a href="http://interaction14.ixda.org/program/thursday/46-pitching-ideas">2014 talk</a>).</p>
<p>To understand Jeroen&#8217;s fascination with storytelling, we share videos of two recent talks:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://creativemornings.com/talks/jeroen-van-geel/1">The Power of Storytelling</a> &#8211; June 1, 2012 &#8211; Creative Mornings, Utrecht</li>
<li><a href="https://vimeo.com/50749574">The Product Narrative: Stories vs Features</a> &#8211; September 26-28, 2012,      Webdagene, Oslo, Norway.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Easing the understanding of sustainability through visual stories</h3>
<p>In her talk <a href="http://interaction14.ixda.org/program/saturday/357-the-visual-emotional-vocabulary-of-sustainability">The Visual [Emotional] Vocabulary of Sustainability</a>, Arlene Brit deals with structuring messages to help audiences connect with sustainability.</p>
<p>Since Arlene Brit is very much a visual storyteller &#8211; centered on the topic of sustainability &#8211; we can only invite you to explore her website Background Stories, to see some of her work.<br />
Check out the videos for <a href="http://www.backgroundstories.com/projects/bicycling-counts-in-minneapolis/">Bicycling Counts</a>, <a href="http://www.backgroundstories.com/projects/construction-preview/">Construction fencing</a>, <a href="http://www.backgroundstories.com/projects/behind-the-scenes-periscope/">Behind-The-Scenes Periscope</a>, or the <a href="http://www.backgroundstories.com/projects/traceproduct-info/">TraceProduct.Info</a> prototype.</p>
<h3>Storytelling Jam Session</h3>
<p>The topic of the Saturday afternoon jam session is storytelling, articulated in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>Damjan Obal is a start-up entrepreneur from Slovenia. In his <a href="http://interaction14.ixda.org/program/saturday/201-a-story-a-day-keeps-the-doctor-away">talk</a> he retraces the steps that led him to create, <a href="http://www.edgartells.me">EdgarTells.me</a>, which allows people who may not be great writers to create and share engaging stories on a simple platform. In the process he became also a better listener, and that is what his talk is really about.</p>
<p>We warmed up to Stephanie Aaron immediately after checking her website&#8217;s <a href="http://www.aarondesigninc.com/about-aaron-design-inc-the-founder.php">bio page</a>, which ends dryly with the hilarious &#8220;Click <a href="http://www.aarondesigninc.com/about-aaron-design-inc-the-founder.php">here</a> to check her earliest known work&#8221;, where you discover her drawings of when she was a toddler.</p>
<p>Her <a href="http://interaction14.ixda.org/program/saturday/401-the-shock-of-the-new">talk</a> is officially about communications but we have a slight suspicion it is also about the transformative power of humor in effective communications. Check her &#8220;<a href="https://vimeo.com/24794051">Hi, my name is Stephanie Aaron and I am here to put you in the hospital</a>&#8221; talk at Open IxD. Her humor is never trivial. It usually opens up a way to communicate deep meaning.</p>
<p>Gaurav Patekar talks about the <a href="http://interaction14.ixda.org/program/saturday/445-toasty">devices of tomorrow</a>. He is particularly interested in &#8220;designing a new generation of devices that won&#8217;t be just smart, intelligent and networked but will have a personality and will be anthropomorphicin their interactions, appearance and function&#8221;.</p>
