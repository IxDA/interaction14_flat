				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have seen a tremendous number of submissions this year. There were over 450, and we only have 50 speaker slots. The program committee explains the selection procedure.<span id="more-474"></span></p>
<p>The guiding &#8216;theme&#8217; we gave to the conference is &#8220;Languages of Interaction Design&#8221;. We see the theme in a very broad, inspirational sense. Clearly, it is not about linguistics, but about exploring the diversity and hybridity of our practice and craft, while getting inspired by other disciplines. </p>
<p>We aimed to shortlist different types of topics and points of view. Initially our list of potential speakers was very long, but the conference theme and the overall motto of IxDA &mdash; &#8220;Interaction Designers create compelling relationships between people and the interactive systems they use.&#8221; &mdash; allowed us to narrow it down. </p>
<p>Storytelling, urban design, education and enterprise were some keywords we had included explicitly in our roadmap, and these topics were brought to life through the five personas we developed for Interaction14. </p>
<p>We think the six keynote speakers offer a balance between different points of view, inspiration sources, expertise and experience in various fields connected to interaction design. The keynote speeches will of course be taking place in a context of talks provided by 50+ speakers.</p>
<p>We have seen a tremendous number of submissions this year. There were over 450, and we only have 50 speaker slots. About 100 members of the IxDA community volunteered to become reviewers. This enabled an objective and blind review process, as well as democratic one. </p>
<p>The program committee could focus on the proposals that were pre-selected by the reviewers. The committee&#8217;s final editorial choices were guided by the conference theme and by the appeal of content to the personas we had developed. It was quite a long and iterative journey with long nights and many discussions, but so far, reactions of potential attendees via the social networks have been great. </p>

<p>Taking 55 out of 450 &mdash; a ratio of roughly 1:8 &mdash; means that many speakers who were not selected are disappointed. But it also shows that practitioners are eager to share their insights. We can definitely vow that the quality is very high this year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The main conference venue of Interaction14 is unique: an early 20th century former industrial site in Amsterdam. A bit of history.<span id="more-481"></span></p>
<p>At the end of the 19th century, two coal gas factories were built to supply gas for street lighting in Amsterdam. The Westergasfabriek (Western Gas Factory) was completed in 1885, strategically located near to waterways, the rail network and access roads. Amsterdam-based architect Isaac Gosschalk designed the buildings in the typical Dutch Neo-Renaissance style. </p>
<p>When the factory shut down in 1967, it was hard to find a new purpose for the area. Adventurous entrepreneurs and artists flocked to the site. It became the meeting place of choice for creative and innovative Amsterdam residents. The creative buzz around the site ultimately led to the industrial clean-up and redevelopment of the area into a permanent cultural park. The historic buildings are completely renovated, but still bear their old names &mdash; such as &#8220;gas holder&#8221; and &#8220;transformer house&#8221; &mdash; referring to their former function. </p>

<p>Amsterdam is a city which calls up many images in people&#8217;s minds. We&#8217;re curious of Interaction14 will change the image you have of Amsterdam.</p>
<p>We think designers are curious by nature. They won&#8217;t travel to Amsterdam just to see the inside of a conference venue. We want to offer the attendees the ability to explore and experience the city culture beyond the clich√©. Yes, Amsterdam calls up many images in people&#8217;s minds. On Friday night, attendees can join on an Amsterdam Journey &mdash; to adjust or reaffirm their image of this multicultural city, that people from 180 different nationalities call their home.</p>
<p>The high population density in the Netherlands requires rigorous planning and design. The government recognized the importance of design for the well-being of its citizens and created a climate where design and design education can prosper. It should come as no surprise that Amsterdam has the highest number of creative professionals per square kilometer in the world. On Thursday night several, local creative communities will host a social event to exchange their passion for design with the Interaction14 attendees.</p>
