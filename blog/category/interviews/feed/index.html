				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Saturday Gillian Crampton Smith opens the last conference day with a keynote titled &#8216;<a href="http://interaction14.ixda.org/program/saturday/520-is-there-a-language-of-interaction-design">Is there a Language of Interaction Design</a>&#8216;. We asked her three questions.<span id="more-619"></span></p>
<p><em>You will be speaking to an interaction design conference. So how would you introduce yourself to this community?</em></p>
<p>In the early 80s I thought I could write a computer program to automate some of the laborious and error-prone parts of my work as a magazine designer. We bought an Apple II and I set to and built myself a tool. I managed to make inputting information so fast that I realized I had to slow it down or I would make mistakes. It made me more interested in the art of making a program fluid to use than the program itself.</p>
<p>With this experience I could see how the ordinary skills and knowledge of a graphic designer—the analysis and organization of information, the design of its visual form to be legible and appropriate— could easily improve not only the aesthetic qualities of software but also its efficiency. I realized, too, that there was an aesthetic pleasure, of course, in something that looks and feels good but also in something that works well.</p>
<p><em>What is the main topic, issue or challenge you have been working on recently?</em></p>
<p>For the past 8 years Philip Tabor (an architect) and I have been teaching interaction design in Venice. Venice throws into high relief the problems of designing new technologies for old societies. (Culture changes much more slowly than technology.) We have been encouraging students to think about the social effects of what they design: can they design things that will increase social capital not reduce it. Can they design things that will sit gracefully in a city as old and as beautiful as Venice? Can they design things that might address some of the pressing problems of the city? Can they design things that are not universal but rooted in a particular space or place? Can we educate students to have their feet on the ground and their head in the clouds?</p>
<p><em>Can you share with us something about what your keynote will address?</em></p>
<p>The craft of artist designers (as opposed to engineer designers)—is to design an artefact that both functions—a house that stands up, a toaster that toasts bread—but also communicates. Not just what it is and how to use it but what it means to people. We read the difference between a house and a hospital, a medicine bottle and a perfume bottle. There is a language of architecture, of products, of graphic communication that people may not be conscious of but they read it. Is there yet a language of interaction design? and if so, can we teach it to our colleagues?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Daniel Rosenberg closes Friday with a keynote titled &#8216;<a href="http://interaction14.ixda.org/program/friday/517-the-de-intellectualization-of-design">The De-intellectualization of Design</a>&#8216;. We asked him three questions.<span id="more-627"></span></p>
<p><em>You will be speaking to an interaction design conference. So how would you introduce yourself to this community?</em></p>
<p>First, as a design optimist, who believes in the perpetual power of designers to improve the world. From global sustainability (my keynote at HCII 2009) to curing cancer the answer is within the hands of creative innovators, if we do the right things. Secondly, as a designer with substantial legacy of UX design patterns that have become ubiquitous in both enterprise and consumer products. And… lastly as an individual that has spent over three decades of his life dedicated to growing the UX community professionally, most recently in the area of corporate UX leadership.</p>
<p><em>What is the main topic, issue or challenge you have been working on recently?</em></p>
<p>I am always working on many different things at once so I don’t have a simple answer for this question. My most recent consulting projects are in the area of medical software, specifically one solution related to diabetes and another for cancer patient coordination. I will be including an example from the diabetes area in my keynote to illustrate one of my main points. I am also working on the reinvention of real estate sales on the web for another client. Real estate remains one of the few areas where the role of “agents” has not been dis-intermediated by the Internet.</p>
<p>Lastly, I have just launched a new forum for ACM interactions magazine that premiered in the January issue on the business leadership dimensions of UX. This of course involves a lot of writing as well as serving as forum editor for guest authors. Would you be interested in writing a guest column? I have one more slot to fill for 2014 magazine issues.</p>
<p><em>Can you share with us something about what your keynote will address?</em></p>
<p>My keynote will focus on the intersection of two topics I am passionate about both of which highlight the limitations and risks in current approaches to design education and UX practice as I observe them today. The first is dispelling several myths mischaracterizing the UX differences between enterprise solutions and consumer products. The secondary theme is how UX as profession is both accepting and facilitating the trend of deintellectualization in our practice and the risk this poses to our ability to successfully create new solutions, products &amp; services.</p>
<p>In my opinion this trend also has the side effect of weakening our ability to function as design leaders within business. We are losing Chief Design Officer roles to recent MBA’s with specializations in design strategy, thereby allowing strategy to become totally decoupled from UX practice. I fear this is not a good recipe for the future though I know that at least one other keynote speaker that strongly disagrees with me on this topic. So… let the debate begin here : )</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Friday Irene Au opens the day with a keynote titled ‘<a href="http://interaction14.ixda.org/program/friday/512-body-languages-of-interaction-design">Body Languages of Interaction Design</a>‘. We asked her three questions.<span id="more-623"></span></p>
<p><em>You will be speaking to an interaction design conference. So how would you introduce yourself to this community?</em></p>
<p>With a background in HCI, I began my career as an interaction designer at Netscape, and then moved on to create and lead Yahoo’s user research and interaction design practice. During my eight year tenure at Yahoo, I eventually led all of User Experience and Design for Yahoo. In 2006 I joined Google to run all of design for Google’s products and services worldwide. Since leaving Google in 2012, I have been advising and consulting with companies and teaching yoga.</p>
<p><em>What is the main topic, issue or challenge you have been working on recently?</em></p>
<p>How to be in the present moment and find joy and fulfillment in whatever I’m doing in that moment.</p>
<p><em>Can you share with us something about what your keynote will address?</em></p>
<p>I have been exploring the mind-body connection and the impact mindfulness practices have on focus, empathy, and creativity. I am excited to share what I have been learning, drawing from my own experiences as well as scientific research. The principles of yoga and current research on the brain and body together form a blueprint for transformation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re very glad Klaus Krippendorff agreed to replace Peter Greenaway as keynote speaker. To get to know him better, we asked Klaus three questions.<span id="more-645"></span></p>
<p><em>How would you introduce yourself to the interaction design community?</em></p>
<p>I believe I can connect with the interaction design community in three ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>I am a designer by education and have worked, whenever I could, on participatory design projects that ranged from the design of information systems to corporate design policies. I was one of the originators of the idea of product semantics. In 2006, I published The semantic turn; a new foundation for design. It advocates a human-centered approach to design.</li>
<li>As a cybernetician, I have written on information theory, cyberspace, systems theory, and cybernetic epistemology.</li>
<li>Finally, in my capacity as a communication scholar, I have been developing social scientific research methods and theoretical frameworks for studying discourse and communication.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>What is the main topic, issue or challenge you have been working on recently?</em></p>
<p>I am weary of technological solutions to social problems for they tend to create new problems and drive a vicious spiral of technologization. I am not sure how to tame that growth while preserving human-centered innovation. My hope is that designers, design theorists and researchers reflect on how their own discourse shapes their projects and actions, in particular, how it embraces the dialogical practices of the stakeholders of their design.</p>
<p><em>Can you share with us something about what your keynote will address?</em></p>
<p>In keeping with the focus of the conference, this presentation will distinguish four theories from the philosophy of language and elaborate on dialogical conceptions of how reality comes to be constructed. To me, languaging – the process of conversing in language – is a creative and fundamentally socio-cultural practice. Language does not merely describe, it creates realities in conversations and actions. Dialogical conceptions raise doubts in several common epistemological assumptions. Questioning them could open possibilities of seeing interaction design in a new way.</p>
<p>Three questions arise from these elaborations:</p>
<ol>
<li>What of everyday languaging can (or already does) inform human computer interactions (HCI) within its algorithmic affordances? Are there limitations or unrecognized possibilities?</li>
<li>Beyond the individualist conceptions of professional HCI discourse, what might it take to enable interactions that facilitate the larger socio-cultural conversations, fundamentally altered by digital technology?</li>
<li>And what does it take for the professional discourse of HCI to embrace everyday languaging. There are no simple answers. My only hope is to encourage conversations on what the discourse within the interaction design community does beyond its boundary.</li>
</ol>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The closing keynote of Interaction14 is titled &#8216;<a href="http://interaction14.ixda.org/program/saturday/506-interacting-in-the-global-city">Interacting in the Global City</a>&#8216;. We asked Saskia Sassen three questions.<span id="more-630"></span></p>
<p><em>You will be speaking to an interaction design conference. So how would you introduce yourself to this community?</em></p>
<p>The eye of the observer, rather than the designer. From a distance, a robust distance, people interacting in urban space look comic — they bump into each other, step on a person’s foot, and nobody takes it personally. They keep on walking or talking as if nothing had happened. Try that in the — usually not so crowded — streets of the neighborhoods, and you have a fight. Add the variety of ways in which people adorn themselves. I love all of this in the global city’s street scene. How do comics writers and designers engage this — if they do at all? I think of this as Open-Sourcing the Neighborhood.</p>
<p><em>What is the main topic, issue or challenge you have been working on recently?</em></p>
<p>Something not very comic… my new book &#8216;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Expulsions-Brutality-Complexity-Global-Economy/dp/0674599225/">Expulsions</a>&#8216;. On how complex forms of knowledge we admire (advanced technologies, complex engineering) in today’s world so often wind up generating simple brutalities. Not even grand brutalities like building a huge water dam.<br />
Further, I ruminate about how a comic strip could capture every week one bit of this connection between complexity and elementary brutality.</p>
<p><em>Can you share with us something about what your keynote will address?</em></p>
<p>The many different ways in which public urban space is constituted in today’s global cities. The diverse types of knowledge that neighborhood residents have about the city: the children know the city at ground level, the homeless know about the night fauna of the city…</p>
