				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unfortunately, Peter Greenaway had to cancel his appearance due to a scheduling change in producing his current film, Eisenstein. This is of course priority for him and we spent these last days searching for another keynote speaker.<span id="more-665"></span></p>
<p>Our plan was to open Interaction14 with a keynote presentation by Peter Greenaway, noted film maker, master storyteller and grandiose speaker. His presentation covered: using technologies in urban installations and museum settings and connecting storytelling to interaction.</p>
<p>We are lucky to have found the perfect replacement. <strong>Klaus Krippendorf</strong> will open Interaction14, with his talk &#8220;<a href="/program/thursday/543-languaging-reality-dialogue-and-interaction">Languaging reality, dialogue and interaction</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>We look forward to this Klaus&#8217; keynote! More about <a href="/blog/questions-for-klaus-krippendorff">Klaus Krippendorf</a> »</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In less than four months, Interaction14 will conquer Amsterdam. We already feel the excitement building up in our community.</p>
<h3>Full conference program</h3>
<p>The conference features a broad spectrum of talks – everything from “The Interaction Design of the International Space Station” to “What my cat taught me about User Experience.”</p>
<p>In addition to cutting edge interaction design, our talks will cover related disciplines such as typography and architecture. There are six keynotes and 51 talks. In short, something to inspire everyone. <a href="http://interaction14.ixda.org/program/">What will inspire you</a>?</p>
<h3>A staggering 450 submissions</h3>
<p>“We structured Interaction14 to let you dream, be amazed and learn during every second,” explained program chairs, Mads Soegaard and Gilles Demarty. The quantity and quality of proposals was so impressive. Unfortunately, we had to reject some fantastic proposals” they added.</p>
<p>There were 450 submissions but only room for 51 talks. To select the best speakers in a fair manner, we worked with 100 peer-reviewers from the IxDA community. Even with their help, there were plenty of meetings and sleepless nights fine tuning the conference program.</p>
<h3>Workshops &#8211; hands on and thought provoking</h3>
<p>In addition to the conference, there are several hands-on workshops. <a href="http://interaction14.ixda.org/program/wednesday/">All workshops</a> take place on February 5 and are limited to 25 participants. We know you will find something of interest. To receive € 60 discount, register before November 30.</p>
<h3>Shape the future of interaction design education</h3>
<p>Today everyone interacts via networks, social media and apps. Rapid developments in society and technology are challenging traditional learning institutions. Some companies are opting for in-house training. Alternative educational platforms such as edX, Udacity and Interaction-Design.org are offering open access to high-level learning materials.</p>
<p>To shape the future of interaction design education, IxDA and our academic partners invite you to the <a href="http://interaction14.ixda.org/program/wednesday/education-summit">Interaction Design Education Summit</a> on February 5. Early bird tickets are € 150.</p>
<h3>IxDA Field Trips</h3>
<p>We&#8217;re organizing two pre-conference field trips to world class interaction design studios, labs and museums. Choose between a tour to Delft or one to Utrecht. Each tour ends with a visit to a local microbrewery &#8211; we’re interaction designers after all!</p>
<p>The <a href="http://interaction14.ixda.org/program/wednesday/field-trips">field trips</a> take place on Wednesday February 5th. Tickets are € 65. This price includes transport, lunch, a guided museum tour and a few beers. There are only 24 seats available.</p>
<h3>Students: participate in this challenge</h3>
<p>IxDA and the Gates Foundation challenge students to improve child health records to make it a more effective way to reach remote populations. Five students will be awarded a scholarship to attend Interaction14 and a master class in Amsterdam.</p>
<p>Undergraduate or graduate students in interaction design or a related program are eligible. Spread the word about the <a href="http://interaction14.ixda.org/student-design-challenge/">Student Design Challenge</a>.</p>
<h3>Order your conference tickets</h3>
<p>Interaction14 is four days of presentations, workshops and inspiration in lovely Amsterdam. We expect to sell out well ahead of the conference. So don’t delay, <a href="http://interaction14.ixda.org/register/">order your tickets today</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On behalf of the entire team, we look forward to welcoming you to Amsterdam.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In his book “The Search for the Perfect Language” Umberto Eco reminds us there was once perfect language that expressed, without ambiguity, the essence of all possible things and concepts.</p>
<h3>Is there a perfect language?</h3>
<p>Every language, every technology and design approach is a take on reality, a way to frame it and understand it. Every frame comes with its own way of interpreting the world. Computers with their abstract language made people’s life complicated. Interface and interaction design popped in to ease the journey.</p>
<p><a href="http://interaction14.ixda.org/">Interaction14</a> will go beyond linguistics and look at languages in their multiple dimensions. We will explore the relationships between people and machines and the patterns that shape design decisions. We will create new ways to look at interactions between people and things.</p>
<h3>Two provocative keynote speakers</h3>
<p>In our quest to expand our horizons, Interaction14 seeks inspiration from related disciplines. Our first two keynote speakers come from the worlds of urban design and comic books. We are honored to have thought provoking thinkers as our first two keynote speakers: Saskia Sassen and Scott McCloud.</p>
<h3>Saskia Sassen</h3>
<p>A Professor of Sociology at Columbia University, Saskia was named as of the Top 100 Global Thinkers by Foreign Policy magazine. Her research and writing focuses on urban challenges and their relation to new technologies.</p>
<p>Her approach is radical, mind opening and politically grounded. Expect provocations on ubiquitous computing and Smart Cities, on Occupy movements, sharing cultures and big data.</p>

<h3>Scott McCloud</h3>
<p>Cartoonist Scott McCloud will bring visual and narrative to our interactive explorations. Scott is best known for his books about comics theory in which he set a new standard for comics as visual language.</p>
<p>His ongoing experiments with comics designed specifically for the web resulted in techniques like the infinite canvas, which allows storytelling in ways not possible in the paged format of a physical book.</p>
